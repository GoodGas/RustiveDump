## **RustiveDump**

**RustiveDump** is a Rust-based tool designed to dump the memory of the **lsass.exe** process using **only NT system calls**.

It creates a minimal minidump file from scratch, containing essential components like **SystemInfo**, **ModuleList**, and **Memory64List**, with support for **XOR encryption** and **remote transmission**.

Additionally, RustiveDump now implements the design of [Rustic64](https://github.com/safedv/Rustic64), allowing it to be compiled as **Position Independent Code (PIC)**, making it more versatile.

This project is a personal learning experience, focusing on leveraging native Windows APIs for memory dumping and building a minimalistic minidump file entirely from the ground up.

## **Key Features**

1. **NT System Calls for Everything**:
   RustiveDump bypasses standard APIs and leverages NT system calls for all its operations.

2. **No-Std and CRT-Independent**:  
   RustiveDump is built using Rust's `no_std` feature, which removes reliance on Rust's standard library, and it's also **CRT library independent**. This resulting in a lean release build of only **18KB**.

3. **Position Independent Code (PIC)**:  
   RustiveDump now implements the design of Rustic64, allowing it to be compiled as `shellcode (PIC)`, making it more versatile.

4. **Indirect NT Syscalls**:  
   The tool uses indirect syscalls, retrieving system service numbers (SSN) with techniques like **Hell’s Gate**, **Halo's Gate**, and **Tartarus' Gate**.

5. **Lean Memory Dump**:  
   RustiveDump generates a focused memory dump, containing only essential data (i.e., **SystemInfo**, **ModuleList**, and **Memory64List**), ensuring no bloated files—just enough to feed your memory analysis tools like **Mimikatz** or **Pypykatz**.

6. **XOR Encryption**:  
   RustiveDump can encrypt the dump file using XOR before saving or transmitting it, adding an extra layer of security to the dumped memory.

7. **Remote File Transmission**:  
   The dump file can be sent directly to a remote server using **winsock** APIs calls

8. **Debug Mode**:  
   The debug mode provides detailed logs of each step, which can be enabled during the build process.

## **How it works**

1. **Enable SeDebugPrivilege**:  
   RustiveDump uses `NtOpenProcessToken` and `NtAdjustPrivilegesToken` to enable **SeDebugPrivilege**, allowing access to protected processes like **lsass.exe**.

2. **LSASS Process Access**:  
   The tool locates the **lsass.exe** process by querying `NtQuerySystemInformation` to get a snapshot of active processes, and then opens a process handle using `NtOpenProcess` with the `PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION` and `PROCESS_VM_READ` access rights.

3. **Memory Regions Handling**:  
   RustiveDump scans through the memory regions of the process using `NtQueryVirtualMemory` and dumps committed and accessible memory using `NtReadVirtualMemory`.

4. **Module Information**:  
   RustiveDump retrieves a list of modules loaded by **lsass.exe** using `NtQueryInformationProcess` to extract the **ModuleList** from the remote PEB (Process Environment Block).

5. **Memory Dump Creation**:  
   The dump is saved locally using `NtCreateFile` and `NtWriteFile`, or sent to a remote server. If desired, the dump can also be encrypted with XOR before being saved or transmitted.

## **Build**

RustiveDump offers several configurable build options through **cargo make** to customize the behavior of the tool. You can enable features like **XOR encryption**, **remote file transmission** and **verbose logging**.

**Available Features:**

- **xor**: Encrypts the dump file using XOR encryption.
- **debug**: Enables detailed logs for each step of the process.
- **remote**: Sends the dump file to a remote server via Winsock.
- **lsasrv**: Filters the memory dump to include only the `lsasrv.dll` module from **lsass.exe**.

### **Build Options**

To build RustiveDump with different combinations of features, use the following commands:

- **Basic build** (save dump locally without additional features):

  ```bash
  cargo make
  ```

- **Build with specific features**

  ```bash
  cargo make --env FEATURES=xor,remote,lsasrv,debug
  ```

- **Build as Shellcode (PIC)**
  ```bash
  cargo make --env FEATURES=xor,remote pic
  ```

## **Memory Dump File Structure**

RustiveDump generates a minimalistic minidump file, including only the essential components for tools like **Mimikatz** and **Pypykatz**. The file consists of three core streams:

1. **SystemInfo Stream**: OS version and architecture details.
2. **ModuleList Stream**: Lists modules loaded in **lsass.exe**.
3. **Memory64List Stream**: Memory regions from **lsass.exe**.

For more details on the Minidump file structure, see: [Minidump (MDMP) format documentation](<https://github.com/libyal/libmdmp/blob/main/documentation/Minidump%20(MDMP)%20format.asciidoc>).
